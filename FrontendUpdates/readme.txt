Integrated backend functionality from Assignment 1 with frontend functionality from Assignment 2.

Login page has added Javascript code containing a basic input validation module along with the corresponding 
function call for backend connectivity. The backend functionality portion was commented out for later
implementation on the FuelRateQuotes solution.

Registration2 page has added Javascript code containing a basic input validation module along with the corresponding
function call for backend connectivity. The backend functionality has also been commented out here as well
for later implementation on the FuelRateQuotes solution.

As of now, invoking the addLoginItem() function from login.html or the addItem() function from registration2.html will add
an item to the database. In particular, it will add an item to the InMemoryDatabase as previously mentioned in the readme.txt
from the FuelRateQuotes solution.

Missing components as of 3/31/2022:

- Unit testing

- the ability to redirect to another webpage after successful login validation

- Backend integration to HTML pages fuelquote, fuelquotehistory, profile, and registration from Assignment 2
